1. `OriginalWalletPage.tsx`: This is the original implementation of the `WalletPage` component. It has some computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns such as repeated calculations, separate filtering and sorting operations, unused variables, and direct mutation of objects.

2. `RefactoredWalletPage.tsx`: This is the refactored version of the `WalletPage` component. The refactored code addresses the issues found in the original implementation and optimizes the component for better performance and readability.
